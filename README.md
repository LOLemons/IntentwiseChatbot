# Intentwise Chatbot
A Chatbot powered by GPT 3.5 made to answer questions about AI ecosystems and their implications

To get started, clone the repository and install all the dependencies in requirements.txt.
Open the `backend.py` file, change the openai api key (which you will have to have gain access to). and change the model accordingly (GPT 3.5-Turbo is initially used)
Then run the `backend.py` file. It will run a flask app locally on your computer.

All the context for the chatbot is provided in `whitepaper.pdf` and is extracted with PyMyPDF. Feel free to provide differing or additional information and change the prompt accordingly.
